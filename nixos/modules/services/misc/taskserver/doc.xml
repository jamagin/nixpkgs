    <title>Configuration</title>

    <para>
      Taskserver does all of its authentication via TLS using client
      certificates, so you either need to roll your own CA or purchase a
      certificate from a known CA, which allows creation of client
      certificates.

      These certificates are usually advertised as
      <quote>server certificates</quote>.
    </para>

    <para>
      So in order to make it easier to handle your own CA, there is a helper
      tool called <command>nixos-taskserver</command> which manages the custom
      CA along with Taskserver users and groups.
    </para>

    <para>
      While the client certificates in Taskserver only authenticate whether a
      user is allowed to connect, every user has its own UUID which identifies
      it as an entity.
    </para>

    <para>
      With <command>nixos-taskserver</command> the client certificate is created
      along with the UUID of the user, so it handles all of the credentials
      needed in order to setup the Taskwarrior client to work with a Taskserver.
    </para>
