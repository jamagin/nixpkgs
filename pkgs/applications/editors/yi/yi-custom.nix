# This is a manually-written expression over an in-tree cabal file.
# It's awkward but this way allows the package user to pass in
# extraPackages without much extra hassle on their end, similarly how
# the XMonad service handles it: the difference is that we don't have
# anything like XMONAD_GHC…
#
# The idea is that the user changes their configs using any libraries
# he likes and then builds it using this expression. Once that's done,
# ‘reload’ and similar functions should all work as long as the user
# doesn't need new libraries at which point they should add them to
# extraPackages and rebuild from the expression.
