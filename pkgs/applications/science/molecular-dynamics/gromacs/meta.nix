  longDescription = ''
    GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics,
    i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems
    with hundreds to millions of particles.

	It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like
	proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of
	complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is
	extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that
	usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it
	for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

	GROMACS supports all the usual algorithms you expect from a
	modern molecular dynamics implementation, (check the online
	reference or manual for details), but there are also quite a
	few features that make it stand out from the competition.
