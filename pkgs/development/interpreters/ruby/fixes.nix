# The standard set of gems in nixpkgs including potential fixes.
#
# The gemset is derived from two points of entry:
# - An attrset describing a gem, including version, source and dependencies
#   This is just meta data, most probably automatically generated by a tool
#   like Bundix (https://github.com/aflatter/bundix).
#   {
#     name = "bundler";
#     version = "1.6.5";
#     sha256 = "1s4x0f5by9xs2y24jk6krq5ky7ffkzmxgr4z1nhdykdmpsi2zd0l";
#     dependencies = [ "rake" ];
#   }
# - An optional derivation that may override how the gem is built. For popular
#   gems that don't behave correctly, fixes are already provided in the form of
#   derivations.
#
# This seperates "what to build" (the exact gem versions) from "how to build"
# (to make gems behave if necessary).
