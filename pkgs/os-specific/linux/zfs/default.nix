      ZFS is a filesystem that combines a logical volume manager with a
      Copy-On-Write filesystem with data integrity detection and repair,
      snapshotting, cloning, block devices, deduplication, and more. 

      LICENSE NOTE: the Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public
      License which is incompatible with ZFS which is licensed under the Sun CDDL.
      While both the GPL and CDDL are open source licenses their terms are such that
      it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both licenses. This means that a
      single derived work of the Linux kernel and ZFS cannot be legally distributed.

      The ZFS code can be modified to build as a CDDL licensed kernel module
      which is not distributed as part of the Linux kernel. This makes a Native ZFS
      on Linux implementation possible if you are willing to download and build it
      yourself.
