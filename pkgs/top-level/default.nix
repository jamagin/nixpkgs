/* This function composes the Nix Packages collection. It:

     1. Applies the final stage to the given `config` if it is a function

     2. Infers an appropriate `platform` based on the `system` if none is
        provided

     3. Defaults to no non-standard config and no cross-compilation target

     4. Uses the above to infer the default standard environment (stdenv) if
        none is provided

     5. Builds the final stage --- a fully booted package set with the chosen
        stdenv

   Use `impure.nix` to also infer the `system` based on the one on which
   evaluation is taking place, and the configuration from environment variables
   or dot-files. */
